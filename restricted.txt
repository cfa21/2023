2023 Restricted Players

Here's the list for the 2023 CFA season. Thanks to Chris Roy for compiling 
the spreadsheet that has this information. The qualifications that will get you 
on the list, as listed in the CFA constitution:

Platoon Limitations

Players who achieve a high degree of success in relatively few appearances 
versus LEFT-handed pitching and carry a large platoon differential will be 
limited in the number of appearances they can make against LEFT-handed 
pitching. The same applies to players who achieve a high degree of success 
in limited appearances versus RIGHT-handed pitching and carry a large platoon 
differential. The formula for determining platoon-limited players:

-- Side limited must have fewer than 60 AB+BB 
-- Side limited must have a platoon differential OPS >= .200 
-- Side limited must have OPS > .700

However, some players who would ordinarily be side-limited but have less than 
20 plate appearances against that side have been removed from this list. DMB 
"normalizes" sides with under 20 PAs by adding replacement-level playing time 
to reach 20 PAs, so several players with a great handful of PAs against a side 
are no longer limited.

Platoon-limited players are restricted to their number of real-life plate 
appearances against their limited side. There are no restrictions on when 
such players can be used, only in the amount of plate appearances allowed.

IMPORTANT: The league office intends to penalize overusage of these limits by 
even a plate appearance. Because most of these plate appearances can be used 
in high-leverage situations, it's incumbent on owners to manage these players' 
appearances, including but not limited to the following measures:

-- Netplaying your home games as much as possible
-- Minimizing home starts by such players, where a reliever from the limited 
   side can use up restricted plate appearances in low-leverage situations
-- Encouraging use of such a player's platoon partner 
-- Using such players with expanded rosters in Innings 8 and 9 road games 
   and deactivating them at home
-- Leaving playing time on the table as a cushion against overuse
